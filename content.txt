1. In Python OOP, **`self` represents the current object (instance) of a class.**

It is used to access the variables and methods that belong to that particular object.

---

## 🔹 Why do we need `self`?

When we create a class, it is just a blueprint.
When we create an object from that class, each object has its own data.

`self` helps Python understand:

> “This variable belongs to THIS specific object.”

---

## 🔹 Basic Example

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print("Hi, my name is", self.name)

s1 = Student("Atharva", 20)
s2 = Student("Rahul", 22)

s1.introduce()
s2.introduce()
```

### 🔎 What is happening?

When you write:

```python
s1.introduce()
```

Python internally converts it to:

```python
Student.introduce(s1)
```

So:

* `self` = `s1` (first object)
* `self.name` = `"Atharva"`

Similarly:

* `self` = `s2` for second object
* `self.name` = `"Rahul"`

👉 So `self` refers to the object that is calling the method.

---

## 🔹 Important Points About `self`

### 1️⃣ It is NOT a keyword

`self` is just a naming convention.

You could technically write:

```python
def __init__(myobject, name):
    myobject.name = name
```

But by convention, we always use `self`.

---

### 2️⃣ It must be the first parameter in instance methods

```python
def method(self):
```

Because Python automatically passes the calling object.

---

### 3️⃣ Used to differentiate instance variables from local variables

Wrong:

```python
class Test:
    def __init__(self, x):
        x = x   # useless
```

Correct:

```python
class Test:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
```

Here:

* Left side → instance variable
* Right side → parameter

---

## 🔹 Visual Understanding

Think like this:

| Without self  | With self                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Just variable | Variable stored inside object |
| Temporary     | Belongs to object permanently |

---

## 🔹 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you are in a classroom.

If teacher says:

> "Name"

No one knows whose name.

If teacher says:

> "Your name"

Now each student knows they must answer their own name.

👉 `self` means **"this object's own data"**

---

## 🔹 Short Definition (Exam Ready)

> `self` is a reference to the current instance of a class and is used to access instance variables and methods inside the class.

2 . class and obj(example)
class has data/attribute and func/methods
    >attributes get called self , methods are called manually
why python is an oops language ?
in python everything is object so we say python is an oops language
